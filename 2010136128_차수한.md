**Alter Bridge - Watch Over you**
===================
###Leaves are on the ground 
Fall has come 
Blue skies turning grey 
Like my love 
I tried to carry you 
and make you whole 
But it was never enough 
I must go 

> 1. **And who is gonna save you**
*When I'm gone? *

> 2. **And who'll watch over you **
*When I'm gone? *


You say you care for me
but hide it well 

How can you love someone 
and not yourself? 

> 1. **And who is gonna save you **
*When I'm gone? *

> 2. **And who'll watch over you **
*When i'm gone? *


And when i'm gone 
Who will breake your fall? 
Who will you blame? 


I can't go on 
And let you lose it all 
It's more than i can take 
Who'll ease your pain? 

Ease your pain 

> 1. **And who is gonna save you** 
*When I'm gone? *

> 2. **And who'll watch over you? **

> 3. **And who will give you strength **
*When you're not strong? *

Who'll watch over you 
When I've gone away? 

Snow is on the ground 

Winter's come

But I'm long gone");
